# About Meggie

Developed at the Jyväskylä Centre for Interdisciplinary Brain Research (CIBR), Meggie is the result of a project that started in 2013, with the mission to make sophisticated M/EEG analysis accessible to all researchers. Meggie builds upon the MNE-Python library to deliver a robust set of features through an intuitive interface.

## Design Philosophy

Meggie focuses on:

1. **Multi-Subject Management**: It makes it easy to work with many subjects' data at once.
2. **Clear Analysis Steps**: It helps users go step by step from starting data to results.

Compared to other tools like FieldTrip, MNE-Python, EEGLAB, Brainstorm, and mnelab, Meggie is unique because it's built with Python, it's easy for anyone to use, and it's designed for handling multiple subjects' data efficiently.

## Plugins

Meggie can be changed and added to with plugins. If you know Python, you can create new features. This helps Meggie grow and helps everyone who uses it.
